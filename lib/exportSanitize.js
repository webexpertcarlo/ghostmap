/**
 * Export-time email/status sanitization — SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (lib layer).
 *
 * BUG-5 #5.1 (2026-07-07): these helpers used to live in
 * background/data-exporter.js (the UI export path). lib/ExportAPI.js (the
 * API-gated export path) hand-rolled a DIVERGENT, weaker copy — a hardcoded
 * block list WITHOUT the CONFIG blacklist and a substring match that dropped
 * legitimate look-alikes (the EXP-02 regression) — and derived Scrape Status from
 * the RAW email, so a fully-blacklisted record exported an empty Email cell but a
 * "success" status (the status lied). Extracting the canonical logic here (a
 * lib-layer module both paths can import — no lib→background layering inversion)
 * makes the two export surfaces byte-identical and kills the divergence.
 *
 * data-exporter.js re-exports cleanEmailsForCsv/deriveScrapeStatus for existing
 * importers (tests, generateCSV); the definitions now live ONLY here.

/**
 * BUG-5 (2026-07-07): derive the "Scrape Status" cell from the email the user
 * ACTUALLY sees — i.e. the POST-clean value (blacklist + garbage filtered by
 * cleanEmailsForCsv) — never the raw `business.email`.
 *
 * The old inline derivation `emailScraped ? (email ? 'success' : 'no_email')
 * : 'pending'` read the RAW email, so a record whose only stored address was
 * blacklisted (e.g. office@yourcompany.com) exported an EMPTY Email cell yet a
 * "success" status: the status lied about the cell.
 *
 * Honest states (coherent with the Email cell):
 *   - 'pending'             — not scraped yet (emailScraped falsy)
 *   - 'success'             — a usable email survived the filter and is shown
 *   - 'skipped_invalid_url' — BUG-7: the website was NEVER fetched because its URL
 *                             is structurally un-scrapable. Distinct from
 *                             'no_email' (implies we DID scrape) and 'scrape_failed'.
 *   - 'scrape_failed'       — scraped, no usable email, and an error was recorded
 *   - 'no_email'            — scraped, no usable email, no error (site had none, or
 *                             everything found was blacklisted/garbage). Truthful:
 *                             the Email cell is empty in this case.
 *
