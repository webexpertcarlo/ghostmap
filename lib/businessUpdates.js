/**
 * Build the DB `updates` patch for an email-scrape result.
 *
 * PIVA-01 FIX (2026-06-09): partitaIva / codiceFiscale / social are
 * ACCUMULATIVE enrichment fields. updateBusiness() in lib/db.js performs a
 * full `put` (not a hole-filling merge), so any key present in `updates`
 * overwrites the stored value. A failed or empty re-scrape (site down,
 * Cloudflare, fetch error, or a high-confidence early-exit before the page
 * carrying the P.IVA was reached) leaves italianTaxCodes = {null,null} and
 * socialLinks = {} — writing those keys unconditionally erased valid values
 * saved by a previous run. The most common trigger is the "Retry Failed"
 * button, whose targets are exactly the businesses that carry a P.IVA in the
 * footer but no email.
 *
 * Fix: emit partitaIva/codiceFiscale/social ONLY when this run actually found
 * a value, so the spread `{ ...business, ...updates }` preserves prior
 * enrichment. The per-scrape fields (email, emailScraped, scrapedAt,
 * scrapedFrom) are still written every run — they represent the current
 * scrape truth.
 *
 * BUG-3 FIX (2026-07-07): the PIVA-01 guard `Object.keys(socialLinks).length
 * > 0` was vacuous for social — offscreen/parser.js extractSocialLinks()
 * ALWAYS returns a 6-key object with null for platforms it did not find, so
 * every successful re-scrape of a site without socials wrote
 * `social = {facebook: null, …}` and the full put erased socials acquired by
 * previous runs. Fix: only FOUND (non-null, non-empty) values count; they are
 * merged per-key over the snapshot's existing social (`existingSocial`),
 * because `updates.social` replaces the WHOLE stored object on the full put.
 * An all-null/empty scrape emits no `social` key at all.
 *
 * @param {object}   args
 * @param {string[]} args.emailList       normalized emails found this run
 * @param {object}   [args.socialLinks]   { platform: url|url[] } map (may be {} or null-filled)
 * @param {object}   [args.italianTaxCodes] { partitaIva, codiceFiscale } (may be nulls)

 *                                         its non-null keys are preserved under the
 *                                         values found this run (BUG-3). Pass the
 *                                         CURRENT record's social (read inside the
 *                                         merge tx), NOT the job-start snapshot
 *                                         (BUG-4 #4.3), so a concurrently-written
 *                                         platform is never dropped.
 * @param {string}   [args.existingPartitaIva] the CURRENT record's validated P.IVA
 *                                         (read inside the merge tx). When present,
 *                                         a run that found only an invalid raw
 *                                         candidate does NOT write partitaIvaRaw —
 *                                         avoids polluting col 54 next to a valid
 *                                         col 6 (BUG-8 P2).
 * @returns {object} updates patch safe to spread over the stored business

 *    re-picks it → no infinite retry loop on a URL that can never succeed.
 *  - `scrapedFrom:SKIPPED_INVALID_URL` → an EXPLICIT reason the export surfaces
 *    (deriveScrapeStatus) and getFailedBusinessesFromDB uses to keep the row out
 *    of the "Retry Failed" count.
 *  - `scrapedAt:Date.now()` → stamps the instant the row was processed/skipped
