// cross-tab, FIFO grant order, auto-released if the holding tab dies).

// across the sendMessage awaits — otherwise a concurrent tab's append would
// block for minutes during a drain (and be lost if that tab closed while
// waiting). Data format is unchanged (compatible with queues already

//                   the same sender gets the same refusal forever, so a retry
//                   can never succeed — dropping is correct (retrying would
//                   only burn cap-100 slots and evict recoverable entries).
//   TRANSIENT (keep in queue for retry):
//     'init_pending' — SW init gate not open after 10s (~L821); NOT saved.
//     'error'        — handler threw (~L1364-1372), e.g. IndexedDB failure
//                      during SW shutdown; plausibly transient.
//     undefined / unknown future statuses — safe default is retry:
//                      business_found is an idempotent fill-holes upsert, so
//                      re-sending an already-saved business returns

// loadConfig() mutates CONFIG.selectors in place via safeMerge (prototype-
// pollution-safe), so the captured CONFIG reference sees the overrides.
//
// KNOWN LIMITATION (flagged for product decision, see FINDINGS): the settings
// UI currently exposes title/phone/website/address selector fields, but those
// keys are NOT consumed anywhere (SelectorEngine uses its own hardcoded
// strategies; only businessLink/scrollContainer/businessCard are read here).
// Wiring loadConfig() makes the MECHANISM real for the consumed keys; making
// the 4 UI fields effective is a separate feature (or they should be removed).
